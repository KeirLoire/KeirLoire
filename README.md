## Hi there 👋 My name is Chester, you can call me Keir.

I work at an awesome company called Open iT, Inc. I work on many different developer roles regardless of what my job description says. I spent most of my time maintaining CI/CD and finding ways for making things convenient during my free time. I love developing bots that are interactive and do important tasks such as booting up machines from Hyper-V.
