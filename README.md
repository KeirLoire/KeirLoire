## Hi there 👋 My name is Chester, you can call me Keir.

I work at an awesome company called Open iT, Inc. I work in many different developer roles despite my job title and description being limited. I mostly do stuff in work such as creating automated tests, maintaining CI/CD, testing, documentation, backend development, and so on.
